Tonight
The stars are shining in your eyes
There's a full moon on the rise
Tonight
The planets are aligned just right
Don't let this chance slip away
Don't wait till the light of the day
My heart is racing out of control
But time is standing still

I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that the moment's here
I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that your love is near

Tonight
A dream is just a kiss away
But you're such a mystery
Tonight
Are you gonna leave or stay?
You cast a spell on me
I'll be what you want me to be
Whatcha gonna do with this heart of mine
You gotta put your lovin' on the line

I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that the moment's here
I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that your love is near

(Hold on) Just put your arms around me
(Come on) We can take to the sky
Hold tight, so right, tonight

(Instrumental break)

I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that the moment's here
I can't wait till tomorrow
It's such a long time
Now that your love is near.
