The last time that I saw your face
It was happy in the heaven of my warm embrace
And you cried when you came
More than any words could say

The last time I was by your side
I was lonely till I looked into your loving eyes
As you cried when you came
And begged me to stay

I was thinking we'd be mad to try
But your love showed me the way
We're not perfect but we're better off that way

I can't wait for something to happen
It's not too late to show me you care
I can't wait for something to happen
All that I have i'd be glad to share

Most nights I just lie awake
And I blame you for the burden of my own mistake
And you cry just the same
But kiss me when I turn away

I was thinking i'd be glad to die
But your love showed me the way
We're not perfect but we're better off that way

I can't wait for something to happen
It's not too late to show me you care
I can't wait for something to happen
All that I have i'd be glad to share

I can't wait for something to happen
It's not too late to show me you care
I can't wait for something to happen
All that I have i'd be glad to
Give up my life if I had to
All that I have i'd be glad to share.
