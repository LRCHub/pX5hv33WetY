A fresh coat of black paint
A lost cause, a fast pace
Like you're on a bad date
A new craze, we're too late

There's ashes in the air around here tonight
Don't care if it's wrong as long as it feels right

Keep it cool, play dumb
Follow rules 'till we're numb
Don't think just aim between the eyes

I can't wait
There's nothing left to borrow
I can't wait
The bomb will drop tomorrow
I can't wait
I've got my bow and arrow
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait, yeah

I can't wait
The days are coming quicker
I can't wait
And I'm just getting sicker
I can't wait
My finger's on the trigger
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait for you

You leave town so you don't have to finish a fight
You don't lose, but this time you might

Slow poke, think quick
Bad blood, but it's thick
Don't shoot 'till you see the whites of their eyes

I can't wait
There's nothing left to borrow
I can't wait
The bomb will drop tomorrow
I can't wait
I've got my bow and arrow
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait, yeah

I can't wait
The days are coming quicker
I can't wait
And I'm just getting sicker
I can't wait
My finger's on the trigger
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait for you

Woah, I can't wait
Woah, I can't wait
I won't wait for you
You know I'm waiting in the car
I can't wait for you
And when you're pushing me too far
I can't wait for you

I can't wait
There's nothing left to borrow
I can't wait
The bomb will drop tomorrow
I can't wait
I've got my bow and arrow
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait, yeah

I can't wait
The days are coming quicker
I can't wait
And I'm just getting sicker
I can't wait
My finger's on the trigger
I can't wait, yeah, I can't wait for you

I can't wait for you
I can't wait for you
I can't wait, I can't wait for you
