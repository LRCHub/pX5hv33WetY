# ONE OK ROCK – Can’t Wait

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
They say
What doesn't kill you
Will just make you tougher
But I've had enough
I can't wait
I can't wait
Now my
Backs on the ropes
Got nowhere to go
I'm ending this fight
I can't wait
You say it's forever
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
You say now or never
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
You wanna pull me in closer
I know I'm better alone
Don't make me say that it's over
I'm sorry I'm sorry
You say it's forever
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
狂う歯車になすすべなく
空回り
I can't wait
I can't wait
深い霧がかかり目の前も白く濁る
I can't wait
You say it's forever
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
You say now or never
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
You wanna pull me in closer
I know I'm better alone
Don't make me say that it's over
I'm sorry I'm sorry
You say it's forever
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
You were always there on my mind
Now it doesn't seem right
Doesn't feel right
I was turning into someone
I don't wanna be
I just wanna leave
You say it's forever
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
You say now or never
I'm sorry I
I'm sorry I
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
